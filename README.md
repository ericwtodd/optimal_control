# optimal_control
This repository includes a senior project that I worked on with Tyler Mansfield for our optimal control theory course as part of the BYU ACME senior curriculum in Spring 2020. The paper discusses our solution to the problem of planning particle motion and avoiding moving obstacles using Optimal Control Theory.
Also included in this repo is the associated code used in our solution: both the code modeling the mathematical foundation, and to animate our solutions.

This project inspired a new ACME lab on "Obstacle Avoidance", which has been featured as part of the Volume 4 lab curriculum since Fall 2020.
See Volume 4 Lab Book Lab #22 for details [https://foundations-of-applied-mathematics.github.io/]. Alternatively check out this link: [https://acme.byu.edu/00000186-a3f8-d200-adf6-a7ff8c110001/obstacle-avoidance-pdf].

Below are animations of the working solutions for Examples 1, 2, and 3 presented in the paper.
