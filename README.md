# optimal_control
This repository includes a senior project that I worked on with Tyler Mansfield for our optimal control theory course as part of the BYU ACME senior curriculum in 2020.
The Paper discusses our solution to the problem of planning particle motion and avoiding moving obstacles using the tools of Python and Optimal Control Theory.
I also included associated code that we used in our solution: both the code modeling the mathematical foundation, and provided code to animate our solutions.
