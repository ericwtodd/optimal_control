# optimal_control
This repository includes a senior project that I worked on with Tyler Mansfield for our optimal control theory course as part of the BYU ACME senior curriculum in Spring 2020.

The Paper discusses our solution to the problem of planning particle motion and avoiding moving obstacles using the tools of Python and Optimal Control Theory.

Also included is associated code used in our solution: both the code modeling the mathematical foundation, and code to animate our solutions. (Animations are included as .mp4's)

This project inspired a new ACME lab on "Obstacle Avoidance", which has been featured as part of the Volume 4 lab curriculum since Fall 2020.
See Volume 4 Lab Book Lab #22 for details [https://foundations-of-applied-mathematics.github.io/]. Alternatively check out this link: [https://acme.byu.edu/00000186-a3f8-d200-adf6-a7ff8c110001/obstacle-avoidance-pdf].
